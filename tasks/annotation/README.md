# Referring Expressions Labeling Experiment

This is a small experiment for collecting annotations of human instructions collected in the paired building experiment. Specifically, this experiment asks participants to identify the referring expressions in each instruction, and identify whether they refer to blocks, towers, scenes, and how many of them.

Development:
- To make experiment timelines easy to set up, here we make use of jsPsych.

# ca_ref_exp_prolific_dev
- development

# ca_ref_exp_prolific_pilot
- n=2

# ca_ref_exp_prolific
- n=8
- updated instructions
  - rename scene to "tower pair"
- added subtowers

# ca_ref_exp_prolific_block_tower
- removed subtowers and tower pairs (i.e. only asks about block and tower expressions)
- streamline instructions
