    "mainInstructions":['<p>In this study we are asking you to help us understand how people use language to talk about block towers like these:</p><img src="../img/scene_demo.png" style="width:300px;"><p></br></p>',
    '<p>In a previous experiment, participants viewed <b>scenes of two block towers</b>, and sent messages to another participant explaining how to build them using the red and blue blocks shown below. Here is an example: </p><img src="../img/message_demo_block_tower.png" style="width:600px;"><p></br>In this study, we want you to help us understand the words people used in their instructions. In particular, want to know when people used words to talk about <b>individual blocks</b> (e.g. “place the <i>red block</i>”, “place <i>two vertical blocks</i>”) and when they talked about <b>entire towers</b> (e.g. “make <i>an L</i>”, “like <i>an n</i>”).</p><p>For each message, please record the number of blocks (<img src = "../img/icons/block.png" class="ref-icon ref-icon-inline ref-icon-block">) and towers (<img src = "../img/icons/tower.png" class="ref-icon ref-icon-inline">) mentioned in the boxes on to the right. Please <b>do not count previously placed blocks or towers mentioned as a location</b> (e.g. "to the right of that L"). Press Next for more instructions.</p>',
    '<p>Please note that some messages may contain both blocks and towers, for example  “<i>2 blocks going up, to make an L</i>” mentions 2 blocks and 1 tower. Some may also contain shorthand (e.g. "<i>blk</i>" for "block", "<i>rd</i>" for "red block", "<i>hzt</i>" for horizontal block) or made up words. All of the messages you see will be from a single person (describing 12 scenes in total). You may have to look at the towers and think carefully about their instructions to make sure you do not miss any blocks or towers! Here are some examples: </p><p><ul class="ref-kinds"><li><i>2 hrzn on top</i>: <b>2</b> <b>blocks</b> (horizontal)</li><li><i>Build an L on the left</i>: <b>1</b> <b>tower</b></li><li><i>red on top of each blue to make an n</i>: <b>2</b> (red) <b>blocks</b>, <b>1</b> <b>tower</b> (the two blue blocks are mentioned as locations and should not be counted)</li><li><i>a blue 3 spaces to the right of the L</i>: <b>1</b> <b>block</b> (the "L" tower is mentioned as a location and should not be counted)</li></ul></p><p>One final thing: there is a small chance that your participant did not follow the study instructions or wrote messages that do not make sense. If you think this is the case, please still do your best to count the blocks and towers in every message, but also press the "Flag" button to let us know to take a second look. That\'s all you need to know! When you are ready, press Next to start on the first set of messages.</p>'
