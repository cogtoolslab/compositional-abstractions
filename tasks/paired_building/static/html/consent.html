	<p align="left" id="instruct-text">In this HIT, you will play a fun communication game with another MTurk worker. Before starting the game, you will be given further instructions and must pass a short quiz testing your understanding of the instructions. <b> Please note that if you have recently completed a HIT from this requester (Cognitive Tools Lab), you might be unable to participate in this HIT. We apologize in advance, and thank you for your interest! </b>
	</p>

	<p> We expect the average game to last between 30-45 minutes, including the time it takes to read instructions and wait for another player. </p>

  <p>The actual duration of the game depends on the cooperation of both players, so we cannot provide precise estimates of exactly how long this HIT will take. While the 'time allotted' for this HIT is longer, we strongly encourage you to <b>only accept this HIT if you can start immediately and be engaged and responsive throughout, out of fairness and respect to your partner. </b> </p>  

  <p>If you find the game is running on the longer side, no need to rush or drop out -- please send us an email (cogtoolslab.requester@gmail.com) and we will make sure you're compensated for your time. We are committed to being polite and respectful in our communication with you, and we appreciate your willingness to extend us and your partner the same courtesy. Thank you! We sincerely appreciate your time and effort, and your contributions to our research are highly valued. </p>

	<p>Note: We recommend using Chrome. We have not tested this HIT in other browsers.</p>
