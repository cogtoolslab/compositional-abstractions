                <center>Building Game!</center>
            </h2>

            <p>

                In this experiment you will play a fun communication game with
                another player on MTurk! Each game consists of 12 trials. On each trial you will work together to build
                structures
                like the one below:
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                REPLACE IMAGE HERE
                <center><img src="images/just_animals.png" alt="Example objects" style="width:400px;height:100px">
                </center>
            </p> -->
            <p>

                One of you will act as the "Architect" and the other will be the "Builder". Every trial will include the
                following steps:

            </p>

            <p>
                <b>STEP ONE: </b>
                The Architect will see the "target structures, the Builder will only see a blank grid.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>STEP TWO: </b>
                The goal of the Architect will be to help the Builder construct the target towers.
                The Architect will use the chat window to instruct the Builder how to buld.
                The Architect does not need to give all the instructions at once.

                Also note that the sketcher and viewer will not be shown the exact same images. For instance, a group of
                five owls might appear
                to each player in a different configuration, such as:
            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                <center><img src="images/owls_v1_v2.png" alt="Example constellations" style="width:420px;height:140px">
                </center>
            </p> -->

            <p>
                The Sketcher will have 140 characters to create their message. Once they are done, they will click “send
                message”.
            </p>

            <p>
                <b>STEP THREE: </b>
                The message will be shown to the Builder, who will then place as many bloacks as they want onto the
                grid.
                As each block is placed, the Architect will see it appear on their screen.
                Once a block is placed it cannot be moved.
                <br>
                When the Builder has finished, they can click the "End Turn" button, and the Architect will be able
                to send another message if they wish, and repeat the process until <strong>8</strong> blocks have
                been placed.
            </p>
            <p>
                <b>STEP FOUR: </b>
                When all 8 blocks have been placed, the Architect can end the round by pressing the "End Round" button.
                The Builder will then be able to see the target outline, and a <strong>BONUS</strong> will be allocated.
                Partial credit will be given even if a block is not perfect, so keep trying even if there is a mistake!
                Then the next trial will begin.
            </p>

            <p>
                For each correct block Builder places, both of you will receive
                <b>an accuracy bonus of $0.02</b>. In addition, you will both receive <b>
                    a bonus of $0.01 for partially correct blocks.</b>.

            </p>

            </p>

            <p>
                The bonus meter below displays the total Bonus accumulated.

            </p>
            <!-- <p>
                <center><img src="images/bonusmeter2.png" alt="bonus meter" style="width:440px;height:200px"></center>
            </p> -->

            <p> A few final notes: First, since you are playing with another
                player, you may see this screen before the game begins:
                <!-- <p>
                    <center><img src="images/waitForViewer.png" alt="initial board" style="width:700px;height:200px">
                    </center>
                </p> -->
                Just hold tight. Another player should join the game within the next
                few minutes. If you're in the waiting room for more than 5 minutes without
                another player joining, please return the HIT and try again later!
                Otherwise, once a Viewer joins, you will be notified and need to
                click a button to start the game.
            </p>

            <p>
                Second, to make sure your work is properly recognized, we ask that you be respectful of your partner and
                the rules of the game. If you are the Architect, <b>try to be clear</b>. If you are the Builder, please
                do your best to be be as
                accurate as possible so you can both earn the highest possible bonus.

            </p>

            <p>
                Third, please DO NOT refresh the page at any point once you start
                the game (including the waiting page). If you refresh, you will not
                be able to rejoin the game you were in and you may not be able to
                submit the HIT. <br> Thank you!
            </p>

                In sum:
                <br><br>
                As an Architect, your priority is to send useful information via the message bar that will help
                the Builder place blocks correctly. After each message, the Builder must place <i>at least one
                    block</i>, so please provide useful messages.
                <br><br>
                As a Builder, your job is to place <i>at least one</i> block each round
                <br><br>
