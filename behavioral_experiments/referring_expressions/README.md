# Referring Expressions Labeling Experiment

This is a small experiment for collecting annotations of human instructions collected in the paired building experiment. Specifically, this experiment asks participants to identify the referring expressions in each instruction, and identify whether they refer to blocks, towers, scenes, and how many of them.

Development:
