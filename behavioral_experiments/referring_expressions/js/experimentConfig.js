    // "mainInstructions":['<p>In this study we are asking you to help us understand how people use language to talk about block towers like those below. In a previous study, participants sent instructions to each other describing how to build towers like these. They described 12 scenes of two block towers each. In this study you will see the sequence of instructions sent by one participant. Each set of instructions consists of several messages, which contain words that refer to blocks (e.g. "place a red block") and sometimes to larger tower structures (e.g. "build a big L shape"). On rare occasions, they may have even referred to an entire scene (e.g. "this time it\'s CL"). For each message, please identify these references, and determine how many entities of each type (block, tower, and scene) are referred to in the message. We will explain how to record these on the next page.</p><img src="../img/scene_demo.png" style="width:300px;">',
    // '<p>First you will list the phrases referring to blocks, towers, and scenes. Here we only want you to record the "noun phrases"- the words referring to things to be placed. This means you should omit verbs (e.g. "place", "put") as well as information about where to place them (e.g. "on top of the blue block"). To record these phrases, copy them into the box below the message, separated by commas. To make it easier for you, you can also copy a phrase by highlighting it with your cursor and pressing the Return key.</p><p>After recording these phrases, please record the quantity of each entity referred to in the boxes on the right.</p><p>Please note that some messages will contain references of multiple kinds e.g. "start building an L by placing two blue blocks on the ground" refers to two 2 blocks ("two blue blocks") and 1 tower ("an L"). They may also contain shorthand (e.g. "blk" for "block" or "rd" for "red block"). Please do your best to count all references to the block(s)/ tower(s) being placed. Please do not count previously placed blocks mentioned as a location (e.g. "place a red block on top of the left-most blue block").</p>',

We are interested in <i>which things</i> people mentioned in their instructions. In particular, we want to know when each of the following were mentioned in each message: <ul class="ref-kinds"><li><b>Blocks</b>: words/phrases referring to blocks (e.g. “place the <b>red block</b>”, “place <b>two vertical blocks</b>”).</li><li><b>Subtowers</b>: words/phrases referring to a part of a tower, larger than one block but not a whole tower (the person above did not mention any subtowers, but could have done had they said e.g. "now build <b>a bridge</b> connecting the two”).</li><li><b>Towers</b>: words/phrases referring to an entire tower (e.g. “make <b>an L</b>”, “like <b>an n</b>”).</li><li><b>Pairs of towers</b>: words/phrases referring to both towers (again, there are none in this example. But someone could say e.g. “looks like <b>Ln</b>”).</li></ul></p>',
