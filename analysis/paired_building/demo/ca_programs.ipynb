We assume that, as people are exposed to scenes with a number of shared elements, they acquire *abstractions*-- patterns they can use to represent the scenes more efficiently (either in perception or language).\n",

    "In this section, we formalize the notion of abstraction with the concept of *program abstraction*. By representing scenes as simple computer programs, we can apply abstraction learning algorithms to propose the set of abstractions participants have in their heads after seeing each scene."

In other words, what is the program, expressed in the current DSL, that most efficiently expresses the block tower the participant is looking at?\n",

Fortunately for us, Dreamcoder libraries uniquely determine this most efficient programs. Programs involving larger abstractions can be found through enumeration.
